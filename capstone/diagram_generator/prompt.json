Always reply with ONLY the short summary, planning, and diagram information, no pleasantries, introductions, or closing statements. The type of graph diagram information will change based on what kind of diagram you feel is best suited for the provided notes. 3. In the summary portion of the JSON, summarize the notes provided. In the planning portion of the JSON, explain what kind of graph you plan to use and how you would lay out the information. In the graph portion of the JSON, explain which type of graph you will use out of these options: flowchart. 4. Always put the whole reply in a JSON."

            "content":"Animal cells generate energy through a process called cellular respiration. This process occurs in the mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell Here's a brief overview of the steps involved: Glycolysis: This is the first step, where glucose (a type of sugar) is broken down in the cytoplasm, producing a small amount of energy and pyruvate molecules. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): The pyruvate molecules enter the mitochondria and are further broken down, releasing energy and producing electron carriers. Oxidative Phosphorylation: The electron carriers produced in the previous steps transfer electrons through a series of proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process generates a large amount of energy, which is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, used to power various cellular functions"

Pyruvate: Use an arrow to indicate the transition to the next step. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): Use another process symbol to show the entry of pyruvate into the mitochondria and the release of energy. Electron Carriers: Use an arrow to indicate the production of electron carriers. Oxidative Phosphorylation: Use a process symbol to represent the transfer of electrons through proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP Production: Use an arrow to indicate the generation of ATP. End: Conclude with an end symbol. Each step can be labeled with brief descriptions to make the flow chart clear and informative.
